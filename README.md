# Escape the Classroom
This was an exam-task done for the university program "Programming for Teachers" which I did in 2022 as a High School Teacher.
This is, in many ways, the catapult that made me choose to get deeper into programming as a whole.


## Tools and technology
This project is mainly built in JavaScript, and also uses HTML and CSS.

## What was the purpose of this project?
The purpose was to:
- Create a game using any programming language
- Something has to move in the game (hover-effect was accepted as moving)
- The game should be a part of a High School project to be used in the classroom

I literally made the classroom into a game with this one.

## How was the process?
The process took time. Not only was there a lot of coding in it, but I also needed to map out a plan for the game.
I had to map out what pictures to take, what text to write, and figure out how it all affected eachother.

It was a fun project.

## Learning Points & self assesment
Looking back at this project now, from the lens of a FrontEnd student in 2024, I am a bit appauled by the CSS. It could definitely look better!
At the same time, I am very proud of this project. Especially the JavaScript part.
